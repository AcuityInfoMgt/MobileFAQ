            <hr />
            <p>Tap the <strong>Mail</strong> icon. You should see both your personal email account (if configured) and your OpenNet email account. </p>

                    <p>You can compose, send, reply, forward, flag, search, and delete emails. You can also move emails to sub-folders if they are already set up. The app is integrated with the Contacts app so that when you compose a new OpenNet email, OpenNet contacts will be included as suggestions when you begin typing in the name of the person you wish to send to. As long as you compose the email from your OpenNet account, it will be sent from your OpenNet email address and reflect properly in the OpenNet email system on your other devices and computers. </p>
