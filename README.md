MobileFAQ
=========

This is an iOS app template for building FAQ files. This can be used as a white label app for companies deploying enterprise application on iOS that want to deploy their help files in digital form on enterprise iOS devices.

The app is written in Swift as a universal app for both iPhone and iPad. The individual FAQ files are stored as individual HTML files in the www directory and utilize the Bootstrap to implement a responsive design. The responsive design adjusts the FAQ display depending on whether the user is viewing the content on an iPhone or iPad.

Developers must populate the FAQs.plist file with a list of each of the FAQ documents in the order in which they should be displayed.
